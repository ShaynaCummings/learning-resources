# Your Learning Journey: Team Activity

The goal of this session is for each team member to share their context as a learner and professional, and reflect on the most effective learning experiences that they’ve had.

**Your homework: come prepared to share your learning journey with the team.** The format will be about 2-4 minutes of you talking about your education and how you came to be where you are in your career today. 

Nothing fancy is needed here - you can choose to either treat this as more of a presentation (with slide deck or other visual/multimedia) or just explain your experience to our group. 

The main topics we’d like you to cover are listed below, with some questions underneath each to get started. You don’t have to answer any/all of these questions; they are just prompts to get you thinking.


**Your previous education**
* When you were little, what did you want to be when you grew up?
* If you could meet your 8-year-old self, how do you think they would react to what you are doing in your career now?
* How do you think what you decided to focus on in school (or college, or grad school, etc) shaped your present career?

**Describe your experience with the most effective teacher you’ve ever had**
* What strategies did they use to teach you? 
* How did it affect your perception of the topic and/or your learning journey? Does it still affect you in your current work today?

**Describe the most effective solo learning experience you’ve ever had**
* How did you end up there?
* Why was it so powerful?
* What effect does it have on your current work, if any?

**Learning in your current work/role**
* What inspired you to become a [your current role]?
* What do you like most about [your current role]? What do you like least?
* What’s the hardest thing (or the thing that you dread most) about working in [your role]? The industry in general? What barriers exist for you to improve?
* Do you feel motivated to learn new things in your role/work/industry? Why / why not?

**Learning and your future plans**
* What kind of role or work do you hope to be doing in 3 years? 5 years? 
* If you could be paid $1mil USD/year to do any job, what job would you pick and why?
